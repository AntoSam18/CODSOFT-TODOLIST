TASK:01-TO DO LIST

I have developed a To-Do List application utilizing three modules: `plyer` for notifications, `sqlite3` for database management, and `datetime` for handling date and time operations. The application stores tasks in a database and sends notifications to the user if a task is overdue. It includes five core functions: creating a task, displaying tasks, displaying metrics, marking a task as completed, and sending notifications. Additionally, there is an option to exit the application. A video demonstration showcasing the application's features and functionality is provided below, illustrating its workflow and key operations.
